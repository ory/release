Several indices have been added to the SQL Migrations. There are no backwards incompatible changes in this release but we advise to do a test-run of the SQL Migrations before applying them, as they might lock some tables which may cause downtimes.

> Make a backup of your database before applying this change.

After applying these SQL Migrations, several queries and endpoints will be much faster than before.
